# Graph Theory Algorithms

A collection of Python implementations for fundamental graph theory concepts and algorithms with visualization capabilities.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:
1. Basic graph operations implementation
2. Graph algorithms implementation (Graph Coloring, Bipartite Testing, Max-Flow)

## Features

### Problem (a): Graph Operations
- Simple graph generation (n > 10)
- Complete graph generation (n > 10)
- Bipartite and Tripartite graph creation (n > 10)
- Havel-Hakimi theorem implementation

### Problem (b): Algorithms Implementation
1. **Graph Coloring Algorithm**:
   - First-fit coloring approach
   - Visualization of colored graphs

2. **Bipartite Graph Testing**:
   - Algorithm to check if a graph is bipartite
   - Visualization of bipartite sets

3. **Max-Flow Algorithm**:
   - Ford-Fulkerson implementation
   - Step-by-step visualization of augmenting paths
