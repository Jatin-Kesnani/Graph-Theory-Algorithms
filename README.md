# Graph Theory Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various graph theory concepts and algorithms as part of the MT-3001 Graph Theory course project.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main components:
1. Basic graph operations implementation
2. Graph algorithms implementation (Graph Coloring, Bipartite Testing, Max-Flow)
3. Havel-Hakimi theorem application

## Features

### Problem (a): Graph Operations
- Simple graph generation (n > 10)
- Complete graph generation (n > 10)
- Bipartite and Tripartite graph creation (n > 10)
- Havel-Hakimi theorem implementation

### Problem (b): Algorithms Implementation
1. **Graph Coloring Algorithm**:
   - First-fit coloring approach
   - Visualization of colored graphs

2. **Bipartite Graph Testing**:
   - Algorithm to check if a graph is bipartite
   - Visualization of bipartite sets

3. **Max-Flow Algorithm**:
   - Ford-Fulkerson implementation
   - Step-by-step visualization of augmenting paths

### Problem (c): Alternative Applications
(Research component - to be documented separately)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.7+
- SageMath
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
